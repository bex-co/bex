## Current documentation retrieval

bex implements Render's documented platform behavior, so this skill links Render's documentation as the reference for how a feature behaves, and bex's own documentation (`https://bex.co/docs`) for its CLI and MCP server. Read Render's pages for behavior only: operate through bex (`bex` CLI, `https://api.bex.co/mcp`, `https://dashboard.bex.co`), never through the Render CLI, MCP server or dashboard those pages mention. Where bex's behavior differs, bex's documentation wins.

Whenever this skill directs you to consult current documentation:

1. Retrieve the linked Markdown document directly with an available URL-fetching tool or HTTP client, such as `curl`. Do not substitute web-search summaries for the document.
2. Confirm that retrieval succeeded and returned the expected document, then read its contents. Saving a file or printing its path is not sufficient.
3. If the request fails or your tool cannot read the Markdown response, open and read the linked HTML version instead.
4. If neither version can be retrieved, disclose that the current reference is unavailable and follow any topic-specific fallback in the skill. Use bundled guidance only for stable constraints, and do not guess at changeable platform details.

When a task requires multiple references, apply this workflow to each one and distinguish the documents you verified from those that remain unavailable.
