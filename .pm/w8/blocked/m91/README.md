# w8 · m91 — Supply PostgreSQL clients in native builds and runtime

**Worker:** worker8 **Goal:** ordinary native backup-processing commands can use the supplied PostgreSQL client tools. **Status:** blocked — needs the user's choice of native tool-supply mechanism ([decision](design.md)); no task started

## Definition of done

After publication, both native clients' fresh first original Free backup-processing builds reach Live without an installer prefix and serve actual runtime archive-to-SQL conversion with the exact source/archive/three-row proofs and native logs. A reviewed multiarch client/library supplier works through the documented native build/pre-deploy/runtime/static phases and intended client/server/archive versions; meaningful real generated-image tests and shared-primary/companion/env/PATH/cache/root/exclusion checks pass. Shared authoring surfaces preserve existing inputs/output contracts. Exact owned fixtures/children/URLs/local resources are cleaned and baseline/quota intact. Explicitly bound unverified cases. Code alone does not close this milestone.

## Source + Goal linkage

- **Source:** Authorized functional CLI sweep402,2026-10-17: two unchanged POST201/native0 first builds fail missing pg_restore after exact source/backup proofs; both one-line install controls reach Live and six real runtime archive checks pass.
- **Goal linkage:** [ADR008](../../../../docs/ADR008-vision.md), [ADR018](../../../../docs/ADR018-render-parity.md) and [reviewed native assembly ADR060](../../../../docs/ADR060-build-worker-reliability-and-performance.md): ordinary hosting build/start commands should work with named runtime utilities.
- **Expected outcome:** A native service can inspect/process PostgreSQL archives with supplied client programs, without bootstrapping them in app code or rewriting CLI requests.
- **Why now:** Both independent native clients reproduce the same missing program while primary tooling and exact input data work; the shared image path has no supplier or newer repair. Existing FFmpeg completion explicitly did not certify this tool family.
- **Render parity:** Included because one native image change affects tenant build/runtime behavior across REST/GraphQL/MCP/Blueprint/dashboard; no new schema field, CLI fork or product toggle.
